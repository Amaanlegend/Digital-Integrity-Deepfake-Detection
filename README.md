🌐 Deepfake Detection for Digital Integrity

In today’s digital age, deepfakes pose a significant threat to the integrity of media, contributing to misinformation, privacy violations, and fraud. Deepfakes refer to AI-generated synthetic media, primarily videos or images where faces or voices have been convincingly altered. This technology can be misused to create malicious content like fake news, manipulated videos, and identity fraud, raising serious ethical and security concerns.

This project addresses the challenge of detecting deepfake content in videos and images by utilizing machine learning and AI models to preserve digital trust and security.

📜 Overview
This project focuses on identifying and detecting deepfake media to ensure digital integrity. The system is designed to handle images, videos, and live streams by leveraging advanced machine learning models and cloud computing.

⭐️ Key Features
• Deepfake Detection: Identifies deepfake content in images and videos using state-of-the-art deep learning models. 
• Confidence Scoring: Provides a confidence score to indicate how likely the media is real or fake.
• User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive dashboard for easy navigation and real-time updates.
• AWS Integration: Efficiently handles large volumes of media content using the power of cloud computing.
